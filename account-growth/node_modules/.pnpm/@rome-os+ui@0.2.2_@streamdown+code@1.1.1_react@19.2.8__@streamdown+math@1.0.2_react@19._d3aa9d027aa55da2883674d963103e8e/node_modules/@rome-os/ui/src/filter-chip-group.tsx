 * Reach for `SegmentedControl` instead when the choice switches between a few
 * fixed views: it is a fixed-width track, and it is the default answer for
 * one-of-N. This is the other shape — a data-driven option set that can grow
 * past the width of its container and scrolls rather than compressing, sitting
 * above the rows it filters. Both are radiogroups, so neither tells assistive
 * tech to look for panels that do not exist.
 *
 * Controlled only — `value` and `onValueChange` are both required, so there is
 * no second, uncontrolled code path to reason about.
 *
 * `T` is inferred from `options`/`value`, so a caller with a union-typed filter
 * gets that union back in `onValueChange` — an exhaustive `switch` in the
 * handler typechecks with no cast. It defaults to `string` for callers that
 * have no union to name.
