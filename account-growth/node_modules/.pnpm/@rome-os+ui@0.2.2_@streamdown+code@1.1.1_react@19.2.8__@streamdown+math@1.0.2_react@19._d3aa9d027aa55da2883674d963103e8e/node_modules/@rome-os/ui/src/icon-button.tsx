// the base below holds the 16px the other two take, exactly as `Button` is
// arranged.

 * Square icon-only button with a required accessible label.
 *
 * Sizing follows the row it sits in, because the names compose: `md` beside a
 * `md` Button, `sm` in a dense toolbar, `xs` for an action inside a row rather
 * than beside it — `sm` would fill a 28px row edge to edge, so `xs` is the step
 * that leaves a gap inside one.
 *
 * The glyph is the caller's, and the step it sits in decides the size: 12px in
 * an `xs` box, 14px in `sm`, 16px in `md` and `lg`. Those are the sizes
 * `Button`'s matching `icon-*` variant gives an unclassed glyph, so a toolbar
 * mixing the two keeps one optical inset as well as one box.
 *
 * A glyph carrying a `size-*` of its own keeps it. Only that spelling opts out:
 * `h-4 w-4` leaves the step's rule matching, and the rule wins on specificity.
