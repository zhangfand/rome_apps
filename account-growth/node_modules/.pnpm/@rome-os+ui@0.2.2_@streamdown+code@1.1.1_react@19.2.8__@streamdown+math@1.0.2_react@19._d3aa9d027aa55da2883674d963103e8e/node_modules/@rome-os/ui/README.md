# `@rome-os/ui`

The shared React component kit for Rome surfaces. One published package that the
dashboard, first-party apps, and scaffolded external apps all import, instead of
each copying shadcn components by hand and drifting apart.

> **Status: filling up.** The publish rail, the CSS canon (`./styles.css`), the
> [control primitives](#controls), the [floating family](#floating-family),
> [`Alert`](#alert), [`Card`](#card), [`Spinner`](#spinner),
> [`Toaster`](#toaster), [`Calendar`](#calendar), [`Command`](#command), and
> [`Markdown`](#markdown) are in. The remaining containers land in follow-up
> tickets. The app scaffold (`packages/app-template/template`) depends on the
> published package, so a release here reaches external apps.

## Install

```bash
pnpm add @rome-os/ui
```

React 19, `react-dom`, and `lucide-react` are peer dependencies — the host
provides them, so the kit never ends up with a second copy of React in the
bundle.

## Import

```tsx
import { cn } from "@rome-os/ui/cn"; // subpath export
import { cn } from "@rome-os/ui"; // or the barrel
```

Every component gets its own subpath export (`@rome-os/ui/button`). Prefer the
subpath in app code so a bundler never has to reach the whole kit to find one
component. Components backed by optional peers stay out of the barrel.
[`Markdown`](#markdown) needs Streamdown, [`Calendar`](#calendar) needs
`react-day-picker`, [`Command`](#command) needs `cmdk`, and [`Toaster`](#toaster)
needs `sonner`.

The stylesheet is a single import at the host's CSS entrypoint:

```css
@import "@rome-os/ui/styles.css";
```

`Markdown` adds a second, opt-in one — see below.

## Components

### Controls

The non-floating primitives. Each takes a `className` that wins over its own
variant classes, so a host restyles one without forking it.

| Subpath | Exports |
| --- | --- |
| `@rome-os/ui/badge` | `Badge` |
| `@rome-os/ui/button` | `Button`, `buttonVariants` |
| `@rome-os/ui/field` | `Field`, `FieldGroup`, `FieldLabel`, `FieldGroupLabel`, `FieldDescription`, `FieldError`, `FormError` |
| `@rome-os/ui/icon-button` | `IconButton` |
| `@rome-os/ui/input` | `Input` |
| `@rome-os/ui/segmented-control` | `SegmentedControl` |
| `@rome-os/ui/separator` | `Separator` |
| `@rome-os/ui/skeleton` | `Skeleton` |
| `@rome-os/ui/switch` | `Switch` |
| `@rome-os/ui/tabs` | `Tabs`, `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, `TabsContent` |
| `@rome-os/ui/textarea` | `Textarea` |
| `@rome-os/ui/toggle` | `Toggle` |

Height, padding, radius, and type size come from the kit's `--control-*` /
`--field-*` / `--badge-*` custom properties, so a `Button` and an `Input` on the
same row line up under any theme. `Tabs` owns a panel per choice; reach for
`SegmentedControl` when the choices switch or filter a single view.

**On/off controls — pick by where it sits.** `Switch` is the form control: a
setting in a settings panel, a value the user is editing. `Toggle` is the
toolbar one: a button that stays pressed. `SegmentedControl` is one-of-N, not
on/off.

```tsx
import { Toggle } from "@rome-os/ui/toggle";

<Toggle pressed={autoStart} onPressedChange={setAutoStart}>
  Auto-start ready tickets
</Toggle>;
```

- Controlled only — `pressed` and `onPressedChange` are both required.
- The component owns `aria-pressed` and the pressed paint; the props type
  refuses `aria-pressed`, so the accessible state can't drift from what the
  toggle looks like. `variant` (`ghost` | `outline`) picks the *unpressed*
  resting look only.
- `size` is `Button`'s vocabulary, read off `buttonVariants` — a `Toggle` and a
  `Button` at the same size are the same height by construction, not by
  coincidence.
- Single-select among N is `SegmentedControl`; there is deliberately no
  `ToggleGroup`.

### Floating family

Everything that renders a layer above the page. Radix under the hood — focus
trap, dismissal, keyboard semantics — dressed in Rome's tokens.

| Subpath | Exports |
| --- | --- |
| `@rome-os/ui/context-menu` | `ContextMenu`, `ContextMenuTrigger`, `ContextMenuContent`, `ContextMenuItem`, `ContextMenuLabel`, `ContextMenuGroup`, `ContextMenuSeparator` |
| `@rome-os/ui/dialog` | `Dialog`, `DialogHeader`, `DialogTitle`, `DialogDescription`, `DialogBody`, `DialogFooter` |
| `@rome-os/ui/dropdown-menu` | `DropdownMenu`, `DropdownMenuTrigger`, `DropdownMenuContent`, `DropdownMenuItem`, `DropdownMenuCheckboxItem`, `DropdownMenuRadioGroup`, `DropdownMenuRadioItem`, `DropdownMenuLabel`, `DropdownMenuSeparator`, `DropdownMenuShortcut`, `DropdownMenuSub…`, `dropdownMenuItemVariants` |
| `@rome-os/ui/popover` | `Popover`, `PopoverTrigger`, `PopoverAnchor`, `PopoverContent`, `PopoverHeader`, `PopoverTitle`, `PopoverDescription` |
| `@rome-os/ui/select` | `Select`, `SelectTrigger`, `SelectValue`, `SelectContent`, `SelectItem`, `SelectGroup`, `SelectLabel`, `SelectSeparator`, `SelectScrollUpButton`, `SelectScrollDownButton` |
| `@rome-os/ui/sheet` | `Sheet`, `SheetTitle`, `SheetDescription` |
| `@rome-os/ui/tooltip` | `Tooltip`, `TooltipProvider`, `TooltipTrigger`, `TooltipContent` |

**They portal to the right root on their own.** A Rome app renders inside a
Shadow DOM, and its compiled CSS lives in that shadow root — so the usual
`document.body` portal would drop the layer outside the app's styles and paint
it half-dressed. Each of these resolves its container from where the component
sits in the tree: inside a shadow root it portals into that root (under the
element the host toggles theme classes on), and in a plain document it takes
Radix's `document.body` default. Nothing to pass, nothing to configure — an
app-authored component still reaches for the SDK's `getPortalContainer()`, but
kit components never need it.

### Command

`Command` is an opt-in composite built on `cmdk`: a search field, filtered list,
and keyboard-selectable items. Install `cmdk` only in consumers that use it,
then import the subpath directly:

```bash
pnpm add cmdk
```

```tsx
import { Command, CommandInput, CommandItem, CommandList } from "@rome-os/ui/command";
```

It intentionally has no barrel entry, so consumers of the rest of the kit do
not need to install or resolve `cmdk`.

### `Alert`

A bordered panel for a status message the user has to read — a failed
connection, a warning before a destructive step, a success confirmation.

```tsx
import { Alert, AlertDescription, AlertTitle } from "@rome-os/ui/alert";
import { PlugZap } from "lucide-react";

<Alert variant="destructive">
  <PlugZap />
  <AlertTitle>GitHub is disconnected</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>Reconnect to keep syncing your repositories.</AlertDescription>
</Alert>;
```

- Five variants — `default` (neutral surface), `info`, `success`, `warning`,
  `destructive` — each painted from one `*-bg` / `*-border` / `*-fg` token trio,
  so a host theme restyles all five by moving those tokens.
- Carries `role="alert"`, so assistive tech announces it when it appears.
- A leading `<svg>` (any lucide icon) is optional: the grid opens its icon
  column only when one is present, and the icon inherits the variant's `fg`.

### `Card`

shadcn's `card` (new-york-v4) restyled to Rome's panel surface: `surface` fill,
a `border` hairline, `rounded-lg`, flat (no shadow). The anatomy is upstream's
— same part names, same `data-slot` attributes, same header grid — so a copied
shadcn card swaps for this one without touching JSX:

```tsx
import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@rome-os/ui/card";

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Delivery</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Where your briefing lands each morning.</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardContent>Sent to Telegram at 7:00.</CardContent>
</Card>;
```

- The Card owns the vertical inset and the spacing between parts; the parts pad
  horizontally only. A Card with no header is inset exactly like one with a
  header — no `pt-0` bookkeeping at the call site.
- `CardAction` is the header's trailing cell (a badge, a switch, a menu
  trigger); the header only opens that column when an action is present.
- A header carrying `border-b` restores its own bottom padding, so a ruled
  panel is `<CardHeader className="border-b border-border-subtle">` with no
  per-site `pb-*`. `CardFooter` does the same for `border-t`.
- `CardTitle` renders an `h3` — the one deviation from upstream, because a
  Rome panel is a titled section and the pages it replaces use real headings.
  A card whose heading belongs at another level passes its own heading element
  as a child instead.
- Rome's scale, not upstream's: 16px inset, 4px title/description gap,
  `rounded-lg`, and `surface` tokens rather than `card` (only `--surface` is
  declared by every theme block; `--card` is a host-local alias).
- Card is for *static section surfaces*. A selectable option in a picking flow
  is a different concept (the dashboard's `Tile`), not a Card variant.

### `Spinner`

The one loading indicator, so a wait reads the same on every surface.

```tsx
import { Spinner } from "@rome-os/ui/spinner";

<Button size="sm" disabled={installing}>
  {installing ? <Spinner size="sm" /> : <Download />}
  Install
</Button>;
```

- Two sizes, `sm` and `md` (default), matching the icon slot of the `sm` / `md`
  control step — a spinner inside a `sm` Button is the same 14px as the glyph it
  replaces, so swapping one in doesn't move the button's edges.
- No color prop. The glyph strokes in `currentColor`, so it takes the tone of
  whatever it sits in — a destructive button, a muted empty state.
- `role="status"` with a visually-hidden name, `"Loading"` by default and
  overridable with `label` when the wait deserves a better description
  (`label="Installing app"`).
- Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the spin slows rather than stopping: a frozen
  glyph reads as a static icon, which is a worse answer than a calmer one.
- **`Button` has no `loading` prop, deliberately.** Composition already covers
  it — `disabled={busy}` is an attribute the caller passes anyway, and the size
  match above keeps the width stable — so a prop would only add a second way to
  say the same thing.

### `Calendar`

The date-grid composite for picking one date or a range. It wraps
`react-day-picker` with Rome's control, radius, and typography treatment.

```tsx
import { Calendar } from "@rome-os/ui/calendar";

<Calendar mode="single" selected={date} onSelect={setDate} />;
```

- Install `react-day-picker` in every package that imports this subpath. It is
  an optional peer, so `pnpm add @rome-os/ui` does not install it.
- `Calendar` and `CalendarDayButton` are subpath-only exports. Keeping them out
  of the barrel lets a consumer import `Button` without the optional peer.
- The root, layout containers, labels, and controls follow the anatomy in
  [`component-roles.md`](../../docs/ui/component-roles.md#composites).

### `Toaster`

The themed Sonner host. Mount it once near the root of each host that uses
toasts.

```bash
pnpm add sonner
```

```tsx
import { Toaster } from "@rome-os/ui/sonner";

<Toaster position="top-right" />;
```

- `sonner` is an optional peer, so consumers that skip this subpath do not
  install it.
- Toast surfaces read `--surface-elevated`, `--foreground`, and `--border` from
  the host. They follow theme changes without a concrete color in the wrapper.
- Rome opts out of Sonner's painted defaults and owns the visual layer through
  Tailwind classes. Consumer `classNames` therefore follow the kit's normal
  last-class-wins override contract without `!important` color utilities.
- Sonner's `theme` and `richColors` paint modes are intentionally excluded from
  the wrapper's props; semantic Rome tokens provide theme-aware colors instead.
- The subpath still carries Sonner's structural stylesheet into the consumer
  bundle for positioning, stacking, swiping, and motion. App bundles therefore
  include those mechanics inside their Shadow DOM.

### `Markdown`

The one prose renderer, so agent output reads the same in the dashboard, in a
first-party app, and in an app someone scaffolded this morning. Built on
[Streamdown](https://streamdown.ai) — a streaming-safe Markdown renderer that
handles a half-written fence mid-token, which is what a live agent turn is —
with Shiki syntax highlighting, KaTeX math, and Mermaid diagrams.

```tsx
import { Markdown } from "@rome-os/ui/markdown";

<Markdown compact>{turn.text}</Markdown>;
```

```css
/* the host's CSS entrypoint, alongside @rome-os/ui/styles.css */
@import "@rome-os/ui/markdown.css";
```

- **Both imports are required.** The stylesheet is deliberately outside
  `styles.css`: Streamdown + KaTeX are hundreds of kilobytes of CSS, and a
  surface that renders no prose shouldn't carry them. An app bundle mounted in
  a Shadow DOM needs the import in its *own* stylesheet — the host document's
  copy does not cross the shadow boundary.
- **Install the peers.** `streamdown`, `@streamdown/code`, `@streamdown/math`,
  `@streamdown/mermaid`, and `katex` are optional peers, so `pnpm add
  @rome-os/ui` alone does not pull them; add them where you import this.
- **Theme comes from the host, like every other kit component.** The prose
  paints from inherited semantic tokens, so it follows the live theme and its
  `.dark` half in a shadow root with nothing injected. Mermaid is the exception
  — its color parser cannot consume OKLCH — so a host on OKLCH primitives
  passes explicit sRGB values through the `theme` prop.
- `compact` rebinds Markdown's own typography and rhythm tokens to their dense
  values. The rendered semantic roles do not change, and hosts use `className`
  for color or layout rather than substituting a generic typography role.
- `preserveSoftBreaks` keeps single newlines inside a paragraph, for surfaces
  where the author's line breaks are meaningful.
- Links are safe by construction: only genuinely cross-origin `href`s get
  `target="_blank"` + `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. A host that routes in-app
  hrefs through its own router passes `linkComponent`.

## Utilities

- `cn(...inputs)` — `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`. Kit components compose their
  variants through it, and consumers use it to override those variants from the
  outside.

## Tier model

Not every component belongs in the kit. Three tiers:

| Tier | Where it lives | What qualifies |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Kit (public)** | `@rome-os/ui` | The curated set that apps and the dashboard both need and that reads the same in both — controls, the floating family, containers. |
| **Dashboard-private** | `packages/web/src/components` | Components coupled to dashboard data, routing, or chrome. They stay put; the dashboard may keep thin shims that re-export kit components under their old paths. |
| **On-demand (v2)** | promoted into the kit later | Heavier or less-settled surfaces (pickers). They move in when a second consumer proves the need, not before — as [`Markdown`](#markdown) did, arriving with its libraries as optional peers so only the surfaces that render prose pay for them. |

## Styling contract

The kit ships the constant geometry and typography values, semantic token
vocabulary, variants, and base-layer defaults through `@rome-os/ui/styles.css`.
The host owns the theme-specific color and shadow values. A host can therefore
restyle every kit component by changing its theme custom properties, with no
fork of the kit.

## Consumers

- `packages/web` — the Rome dashboard.
- `rome_apps/*` — first-party apps, through their web bundles.
- Scaffolded external apps — via the app template.

Explicit non-goals: `packages/desktop-base-web` and the
mobile app. They are not on this design system and pulling them in would fix the
kit's API to surfaces it does not serve.

## Dependency policy

- **Peer dependencies** — `react`, `react-dom` (>= 19), `lucide-react`.
- **Dependencies** — small, universal, and safe to duplicate: `clsx`,
  `tailwind-merge`, `class-variance-authority`, and the Radix primitives the
  components are built on. The floating family's Radix packages are pinned to
  exact versions and bumped together: they pin `@radix-ui/react-dismissable-layer`
  exactly, and two copies of that package fight over
  `document.body.style.pointerEvents`.
- **Never a dependency** — heavy tails such as `streamdown` + its
  code/math/mermaid plugins, `katex`, `@dnd-kit/*`, `react-day-picker`, `cmdk`,
  and `sonner`. Components that need them arrive as subpath exports with the
  library declared as an *optional* peer, so an app that imports a button never
  pays for a calendar. [`Calendar`](#calendar), [`Command`](#command), and
  [`Markdown`](#markdown) are the worked examples. All use subpath-only exports
  and optional peers. Markdown also has its own opt-in stylesheet.

## Releasing

Published to npm as `@rome-os/ui` by release-please, on the same rail as
`@rome-os/app-runtime` and `@rome-os/app-web-sdk`. Commits touching this package
must be Conventional (`feat:` / `fix:` / `feat!:`) — see
