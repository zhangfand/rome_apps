 * Radix's portal with the container resolved from where the component sits in
 * the tree: the app's shadow root when there is one, Radix's `document.body`
 * default otherwise. Every floating component in the kit wraps its content in
 * this instead of the bare primitive, which is what makes them correct in both
 * hosts by construction.
 *
 * `resolvePortalContainer` needs a live DOM node to resolve from, and a portal
 * has none of its own — its content is elsewhere by definition. Hence the
 * hidden marker: it renders at the component's own position in the light DOM,
 * so its root node is the app's shadow root exactly when the floating layer
 * belongs there.
 *
 * A resolver that finds no shadow root leaves the state untouched, so in a
 * plain document (the dashboard) this renders exactly what the bare primitive
 * would, in the same single pass — no extra commit to shift the timing Radix's
 * open/close/focus-restore sequence runs on.
 *
 * Inside a shadow root the container arrives one commit later, and changing a
 * `createPortal` target re-creates the portaled subtree. That is deliberate:
 * the swap happens at *this* component's mount, when a closed layer has no
 * portaled children at all (Radix gates them behind `Presence`), so the remount
 * is of an empty portal. A layer already open at mount does take a real
 * remount — `dialog.test.tsx` pins that it keeps focus — and paying it there
 * buys the dashboard's 68 call sites an unchanged render path.
